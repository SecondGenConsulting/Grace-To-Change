												<h3>Shannon White, LCDC, Executive Director</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Shannon White LCDC graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in early childhood education.  After her last drink on August 24, 2007 she left the teaching field and went back to school to get her LCDC license.  In 2011 the dream of having a treatment center where she would have wanted to begin her recovery became a reality with GraceToChange.  Shannon has participated in multiple drug courts, has voluntarily taught 2 classes a week of MRT inside the Collin County Jail since 2014 and has become an avid advocate for those suffering from the disease of addiction.  Her idea for Tiny House Big Recovery was born because of her time in the jail with women who wanted a different life but housing was a roadblock.</p>
